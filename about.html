            <p>
                I work at the intersection of <strong>AI, data science, and engineering</strong>,
                with a focus on understanding complex <strong>time-series and biosignal data</strong>.
                Recently, I’ve been exploring <strong>sleep research, EEG analysis, and emerging healthtech
                applications</strong>, aiming to build tools that make physiological data more interpretable
                and accessible.
            </p>

            <p>
                My background includes a <strong>Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering</strong>
                and a <strong>Master’s degree in Business Analytics</strong>, giving me a foundation
                in both technical development and analytical problem-solving. I enjoy working with Python,
                machine learning, and signal processing methods to uncover patterns in noisy real-world data.
            </p>

            <p>
                I’m particularly interested in how AI can support insights in <strong>sleep, neurodata,
                and digital health</strong>, and I’m gradually expanding my work toward open-source projects
                that bridge data science with human physiology.
